"""A configured segmenter: execution policy set once, models kept warm between calls.

``haversack.segment(image, task)`` is the right shape for a script - everything decided per call,
nothing retained. A Slicer module, an MCP tool or a REST endpoint wants the opposite: the
device, weights root and dtype are properties of the *deployment*, fixed at startup, and
reloading a checkpoint on every request is the difference between a service and a toy.

:class:`Segmenter` holds that policy plus a :class:`~haversack.cache.ModelCache`, and exposes the
same operation as a method. Per-call arguments still win, so a caller can override anything for
one request without building a second Segmenter.
