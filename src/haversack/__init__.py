"""haversack - nnU-Net-family segmentation on torch (MPS / CUDA / CPU).

Two layers in one package, kept apart by a rule the tests enforce
(``tests/test_layering.py``): the **kernel layer** - ``grid``, ``mapping``, ``tables``,
``restore``, ``resample``, ``shuffleup``, ``backends``, ``reference`` - depends on nothing but
torch and numpy and knows nothing about tasks, plans, weights or files, so it stays a leaf that
could be lifted out as its own package the day something outside wants it. The **pipeline
layer** - ``io``, ``preprocess``, ``frame``, ``network``, ``pipeline``, ``cli`` - reads images
through SimpleITK, drives nnU-Net's networks, and composes tasks from the toolkit's catalog.
"""
# Eager imports are the torch-FREE surface: importing haversack costs only these. The
# inference path (torch) is loaded lazily on first access (see _LAZY / __getattr__
# below), so `import haversack` pulls no torch - a lean consumer (the serve front-end, a
# describe-only caller) never pays for it. Enforced by tests/test_layering.py.
