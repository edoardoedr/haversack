"""Model ecosystems: where models come from, as pluggable registries.

The mirror of :mod:`haversack.sources` - sources answer "where inputs come from",
ecosystems answer "where models come from". A :class:`ModelEcosystem` names its
tasks, installs their weights, and materializes each task's :class:`TaskSpec`.
The rule learned from the stale total_mr class map applies throughout:
**the checkpoint is the spec** - a catalog holds only what the checkpoint
cannot know (where to download it, and how to compose multiple models).

**An ecosystem is a catalog, not a runtime.** What runs a task is an *engine*
(:mod:`haversack.engines.registry`), named by ``ModelEcosystem.engine``; many
ecosystems map to one engine. The four nnU-Net catalogs below all run on
``nnunetv2``; FastSurfer and SynthStrip each bring a catalog *and* an engine.

The nnU-Net catalogs:

- ``ts.v2`` - the TotalSegmentator v2 catalog. Its tasks are *compositions* (unions,
  cascades, remaps) that exist only as application logic, so it carries a full
  task registry (guarded by the remap drift test).
- ``ts.v3`` - TotalSegmentator v3's ``total_v3`` (Datasets 831-837), listed as
  ``total``/``total_fast``/``total_fastest``: the catalog name carries the ``_v3``. Same
  shape as ``ts.v2``, its own registry (``tools/gen_ts_registry.py``), the same weights
  manifest - TotalSegmentator's dataset ids are one namespace.
- ``moose`` - MOOSE/moosez models. Bare, self-describing nnU-Net checkpoints
  on public release assets: the manifest holds name -> url + folder, and the
  spec is read from the installed checkpoint's own dataset.json.
- ``mrsegmentator`` - MRSegmentator's two whole-body MRI models, the same
  shape as ``moose`` (bare checkpoints, manifest of url + folder + version)
  with one fact the checkpoint cannot know: its packaging forces LPS.
- ``lnq`` - Steve Pieper's four CT lymph-node models, 4-5-fold ensembles whose release zips
  hold whole training checkpoints; the install reads each fold's network weights in place
  over HTTP Range and never downloads the optimizer state.
- ``custom`` - local model folders the operator registers explicitly.

Engine catalogs (present only where their engine is enabled, so the catalog can
never list a task no worker can run): ``fastsurfer``, ``synthstrip``,
``voxtell`` (free-text prompts), ``monai`` (the model-zoo bundles - the first
catalog of many tasks on a NEW engine, and the first with multi-input models).

An :class:`EcosystemCatalog` federates a registry of ecosystems behind the
same interface :class:`haversack.tasks.TaskCatalog` exposes, so ``Segmenter`` and
the server run unchanged. Tasks whose weights are not yet installed are
listed but unmaterialized: ``info()`` says so without downloading, ``get()``
installs on demand (the same behavior TS weights ids always had).

Naming has three layers (user decision 2026-08-25): the **canonical name is
ecosystem-qualified** (``ts.v2:total_fast``, ``moose:clin_ct_fast_organs``) and
is what listings, result-cache keys, and provenance carry; the **short name**
is a resolution convenience, accepted when exactly one ecosystem offers it
and refused with the qualified candidates when ambiguous - so two ecosystems
may legitimately ship the same short name; beneath both sits the **hash**,
the content-addressed result key. Nothing rejects collisions anymore; only
the ambiguous short form becomes unusable.

    checkpoints for abdominal / pelvic / thoracic MRI - ``base`` (40 structures,
    also usable on CT) and ``body_comp`` (10 body-composition classes).

    Same shape as :class:`MooseEcosystem` - bare checkpoints on public assets,
    labels read from each installed checkpoint's own dataset.json - with two
    differences that are properties of the *packaging*, not of the checkpoint:

    - **The zips are flat.** ``dataset.json``, ``plans.json``, ``version.json``
      and ``fold_0..4/`` sit at the top level, so the unit that must land
      atomically is the *configuration* folder, not a ``Dataset*`` parent. Each
      model is installed under ``<root>/mrsegmentator/<Dataset>/<trainer>__
      <plans>__<config>/`` (the names come from the checkpoint itself - see
      tools/gen_mrsegmentator_manifest.py) via a staging directory and one
      rename, and ``materialized()`` looks only at that folder.
    - **The reader forces LPS.** MRSegmentator replaces nnU-Net's reader with one
      that ``DICOMOrient``s every input to LPS before the network, while the plans
      still declare ``SimpleITKIO`` (no reorientation). Both models were trained
      without mirroring, so left/right is a real fact to the network, and following
      the declared reader would feed it acquisition order instead. The spec
      therefore carries ``orientation="LPS"`` - the one line the checkpoint cannot
      say about itself.

    The manifest tag is upstream's own ``weights_version`` (the number inside each
    zip's ``version.json``), so a pinned install is checked against the bytes on
    disk twice: the install sidecar, and the version file the zip itself carries.

    Folds: upstream's default is the five-fold ensemble with mirroring TTA; its
    ``--fast`` runs fold 0 alone with no mirroring. haversack's default (fold 0, no
    mirroring, step 0.5) is the latter; pass ``folds=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`` for the
    ensemble.

    **Its plans permute the axes** (``transpose_forward=(1, 0, 2)``), which
    haversack refuses by default, so running it needs ``allow_transpose=True``
    (the command line and the server each expose it as ``--allow-transpose``). The transposed path has

    project-wide policy and is left as it is.

    The reference client (the DentalSegmentator Slicer extension) also removes
    connected components under 60 mm³ from every structure except the mandibular
    canal; haversack does no post-processing, so its output carries speckle that

class TotalVibeEcosystem(ZipManifestEcosystem):
    """TotalVibeSegmentator (Graf et al., Apache-2.0): stock nnU-Net v2 models for
    whole-torso VIBE MRI, plus the CT and single-organ models published beside
    them - ``vibe`` (72 structures, axial), ``vibe_sagittal``, ``ct_bones``,
    ``body_regions``, ``vertebrae``, ``feet_bones`` and ``pancreas``.

    Two things differ from the MOOSE shape, both properties of the packaging:

    - **The zip has no Dataset parent.** Its top level is the
      ``<trainer>__<plans>__<config>`` folder (five of the seven also carry an
      ``other_downloads.json`` beside it, naming the extra-fold assets upstream
      would fetch next), so ``_unpack_into`` puts the contents inside
      the ``Dataset<id>`` directory this catalog creates - which is what
      upstream's own downloader does, and what makes the result an ordinary
      nnU-Net results tree.
    - **The orientation is per model and the checkpoint states it.** Upstream
      reorients every input to a model's own axis codes before the network (RAS
      for the whole-body and CT models, LPS for the body-region, vertebra and
      pancreas ones) while the plans still declare ``SimpleITKIO``, which does not
      reorient. That is MRSegmentator's LPS problem exactly, except here upstream
      records the answer in each ``dataset.json`` - so :meth:`spec` reads it and
      nothing is hardcoded.

    The release publishes more models than this catalog offers, and the manifest
    accounts for **every** one of them: seven tasks, and twelve recorded
    exclusions with a reason each - multi-channel (the nnU-Net path takes one
    input image), unreadable (published without ``dataset.json``/``plans.json``),
    or single-channel but outside the curated set. ``tools/gen_totalvibe_manifest.py``
    verifies each reason against the asset and refuses to run if the release
    grows a model that is in neither list, so a drop cannot be silent. Upstream's
    extra ``_1``/``_2`` assets are further folds; haversack's default is fold 0,
    so the base asset is what installs.

    Three assets are published with no digest, and the manifest says which
    (``unverified``): their download is checked against nothing, because GitHub
    states nothing to check it against.

    ``vibe_sagittal`` and ``pancreas`` permute the axes in their plans, so they
    need ``allow_transpose=True`` like :class:`DentalSegmentatorEcosystem`; the
    other five run by default.

    ``feet_bones`` carries a ``labels_mapping`` that upstream applies after
    inference, renumbering 19 of its structures into the 99-117 range. haversack
    does not apply it, so its label INTEGERS differ from upstream's for that task
    while the names are unchanged and correctly paired - ``mask("100")`` finds the
    same structure either way, but a numerical diff against an upstream NIfTI
    will not line up.

    ``body_regions`` and ``feet_bones`` report numbered structures (``"1"``,
    ``"2"``, ...) because that is what their checkpoints' own ``dataset.json``
    calls them. Upstream names those regions in its README only, and a class map
    written here from prose is the stale-class-map failure this package refuses
    everywhere else - so the numbers stand until upstream names them.

class CADSEcosystem(ZipManifestEcosystem):
    """CADS (Xu et al., arXiv 2507.22953): nine nnU-Net v2 ResEnc-L checkpoints, one per model
    group (T551-T559), naming 167 CT structures between them - ``organs``, ``vertebrae``,
    ``cardiac``, ``muscles``, ``ribs``, ``oar``, ``head``, ``headneck`` and ``bodyregions``.
    The weights are upstream's ``open`` release (CC BY-SA 4.0). Its ``research`` weights are
    non-commercial and its ``reference`` weights add challenge datasets under their own terms,
    and haversack has no license gate to offer either behind.

    The packaging is MOOSE's: a ``Dataset<id>`` parent, and macOS zip litter the installer
    drops. One fact is missing from the checkpoint's account of itself, and :meth:`spec`
    states it: **CADS preprocesses the TotalSegmentator way** - reorient to RAS, resample with
    TotalSegmentator's ``change_spacing`` - while its plans say ``SimpleITKIO`` and its
    ``dataset.json`` declares no orientation. Read as a stock nnU-Net model, every
    left/right structure came out on the wrong side (mean Dice 0.034 against upstream). With
    lineage ``ts`` and ``interp="nearest"`` - upstream restores its labels nearest-neighbor -
    all nine matched upstream's own inference at 0.998-1.0 over the whole volume of a
    chest-abdomen-pelvis and a whole-body CT (2026-09-11), and ``organs`` through this
    catalog on MPS agreed on 99.9995 % of voxels (2026-09-12). haversack's default linear
    restore moves boundaries off upstream's: ``organs`` at mean Dice 0.970, its adrenals 0.91.

    Three differences from upstream remain, and are documented rather than hidden:

    - CADS's copy of ``change_spacing`` pads with scipy's ``constant`` 0 HU where
      TotalSegmentator's uses ``nearest``, and haversack resamples the TotalSegmentator way.
      Only short volumes notice: a 34-slice head CT matched at 0.977-0.998.
    - Upstream runs ``head`` and ``headneck`` only when ``cardiac`` finds a brain, crops them
      to a box around it, and removes small components from five groups. haversack runs each
      task as asked and post-processes nothing.
    - Each task is one model, and there is no combined task. The nine overlap by design -
      ``bodyregions`` holds the cavities and tissues the other groups subdivide - so one label
      map of all nine loses structures: upstream's own paints the thoracic cavity over every
      lung lobe.

    """LNQ (Steve Pieper, Isomics; github.com/pieper/lnq-segmenter): four CT lymph-node models,
    one per region - ``inguinal-v1``, ``abdominopelvic-v1``, ``axillary-v1``,
    ``mediastinal-v1``. Stock nnU-Net v2 (nnUNetTrainer, ResEnc-M plans, 3d_fullres, one CT
    channel, ``SimpleITKIO``), so the native path runs them as they are; each is a 4- or 5-fold
    ensemble, and :meth:`spec` states its folds so a run uses all of them (fold 0 alone marked
    about twice the ensemble's volume on a chest CT, 2026-10-18). Upstream calls them
    "unvalidated preliminary work, not for clinical use".

    **The packaging is its own.** A release is a small ``meta.zip`` (``dataset.json``,
    ``plans.json``, the fingerprint and a model card, at the archive's top level) and one zip
    per fold holding ``<folder>/fold_N/checkpoint_final.pth`` - 815-819 MB, half of it the
    optimizer's momentum, which inference never reads. So the install does not download the
    folds: it reads each checkpoint IN PLACE inside its release zip over HTTP Range
    (:mod:`haversack.torchfree`, with no pickle executed), takes ``network_weights`` alone, and
    checks it against the digest the manifest recorded when ``tools/gen_lnq_manifest.py``
    verified the whole zip against upstream's own sha256. What lands is a weights-only
    ``checkpoint_final.pth`` per fold beside upstream's json files, in the stock layout
    ``<root>/lnq/Dataset<id>_<name>/<trainer>__<plans>__<config>/``, published by one rename -
    about 410 MB per fold read instead of 815 MB downloaded.

    No labeling scheme is declared: upstream names the one class two ways - ``mediastinal_ln``
    in the checkpoint's ``dataset.json``, ``lymph_node`` in its registry and model cards - and
    a store holds the checkpoint's. The registry's SNOMED codes are kept in the manifest.
