    """Segment an image with a task from the toolkit's catalog.

    ``image`` is a path to anything SimpleITK reads - NIfTI, NRRD, MetaImage, a DICOM series
    directory - or a SimpleITK image the caller already holds.

    ``task`` is a catalog name, a ``TaskSpec``, or a path to a stock nnU-Net result folder
    (``.../Dataset<id>_<name>/<trainer>__<plans>__<config>/``, or the dataset folder - then
    ``configuration`` picks among 2d / 3d_lowres / 3d_fullres, preferring 3d_fullres).

    ``convention`` defaults to ``"auto"``: ``"center"`` (skimage half-pixel, plus crop-to-nonzero)
    for nnU-Net-native models, ``"corner"`` (TotalSegmentator's ``change_spacing``, no crop) for
    the TS catalog - each model's own training-time preprocessing.

    ``device`` defaults to ``"auto"``: CUDA, then MPS, then CPU.

    ``folds`` defaults to the folds the task's catalog says its model is an ensemble of
    (``TaskSpec.folds``: LNQ's 4-5), else fold 0; a caller's own choice wins.

    ``resampling_order`` is the spline order of a TotalSegmentator model's forward resample; 3
    (cubic) matches what nnU-Net trained the models with. A native nnU-Net model follows its own
    plans instead (``resampling_fn_data_kwargs``, recorded per model in the provenance as
    ``resampling``), as nnU-Net's preprocessor does. TotalSegmentator 2.x defaulted to 1 for speed (a mild
    train/test mismatch that grows with the downsampling factor); its v3 branch defaults to 3
    again, since its forward resample runs on the GPU (2026-09-09).

    ``envelope_mm`` restricts inference to the patient's bounding box (air removed, largest
    connected component, plus this margin in mm): up to half the patches on a CT with air
    around the body, and NOT the same labels - cropping re-tiles the sliding window
    and the labels move with it (see :func:`~haversack.envelope.worth_cropping`), so it is off
    by default since 2026-09-11, when it was 20 mm. The air cut is the CT -500 HU threshold for
    CT models and a data-driven (Otsu) split for per-image-normalized MRI. ``None`` or ``0``
    runs the full volume, as ``--envelope 0`` does on the command line (before 2026-09-11, 0
    here meant a crop flush to the skin; see :func:`~haversack.envelope.envelope_margin`).

    ``batch_size`` is patches per forward pass: an int, or ``"auto"`` - 1 on Apple silicon
    (measured fastest), 4 on CUDA when the measured working set says it fits (18 % faster
    steady-state on an A10); it only applies when the accumulator is on the device.

    ``probabilities`` is a :class:`~haversack.ranked.RankedSpec`; when given, each part's output
    distribution is encoded from its logits (before the restore frees them) and handed to the
    spec's sink as a :class:`~haversack.ranked.RankedCode` on that model's own grid. Off by
    default: labels are a fraction of the size and most callers want only those.

    ``remove_small_blobs`` is TotalSegmentator's ``--remove_small_blobs``: every class's
    face-connected pieces of 200 mm3 or less (a number: that many mm3) are zeroed in the result,
    after the task's own postprocessing and before a ``remove_outside`` step, as upstream orders
    them. Off by default, as upstream's is. A task's own postprocessing (``body``'s largest trunk,
    ``heartchambers_highres``' remove-outside: :mod:`haversack.postprocess`) always runs; the
    probabilities are the network's, before any of it.

    ``cancel`` is a :class:`~haversack.progress.CancelToken`; the run stops at the next patch
    boundary. ``progress`` is called with a :class:`~haversack.progress.Progress` snapshot (which
    prints readably, so a ``lambda p: print(p)`` callback works).

    ``models`` is a :class:`~haversack.cache.ModelCache`; pass one with ``capacity>=1`` (or use
    :class:`~haversack.segmenter.Segmenter`) to keep models warm between calls instead of rebuilding
    them every time - the difference between a script and a server.

    ``accumulate`` picks where the sliding-window accumulator lives: ``"auto"`` (from the
    device's free memory), ``"device"`` (fastest, needs headroom), ``"host"``.

    Returns a :class:`~haversack.result.Segmentation`: ``.labels`` is the label volume as a SimpleITK
    image in the *input's* orientation on the requested grid (``"input"`` = the input grid, a number =
    isotropic at that spacing, a ``Grid`` = as given). It also carries ``.array``, ``.mask(name)``,
    ``.present()``, ``.volumes_ml()``, ``.save(path)``, ``.timings`` and ``.provenance`` - what
    models, folds, device and preprocessing policy actually ran.
    Multi-model tasks composite at the label level in part order (later parts win).
