"""The kernel layer must stay a leaf.

``haversack`` holds two layers in one package. The kernel modules know nothing about tasks, plans,
weights or files - torch and numpy only, plus rankfield (the ranked encoding, already lifted out
as of 0.6.0; ``ranked`` is a shim over it) - so they could be lifted into their own package the
day something outside wants them (nnU-Net's export path, TotalSegmentator, MOOSE, a CUDA user
who only needs the fused restore). That property is easy to lose by accident and cheap to
check, so it is checked here rather than trusted.

        pattern - `test_*.py` wants the prefix, `*_test.py` the suffix, and

        They cost 1.3 s. Renaming them to `test_kernel_*.py` on 2026-09-08 was the fix.

        The FIRST version of this guard compared filenames against the configured
        `python_files` and was itself hollow, three ways: it globbed one directory so a
        `tests/kernel/` subdirectory reinstated the bug one level down; a
        `collect_ignore_glob` in conftest removed 99 tests with the guard still green;
        and `python_files` is only one of four gates, so dropping `unittest.TestCase`

        is collected ONLY because it subclasses TestCase, none being `Test`-prefixed, so
        one edit there deletes a whole checklist section. The fix is to stop modeling
